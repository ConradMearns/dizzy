# DIZZY

## Overview

DIZZY is an opinionated software development philosophy and accompanying toolkit for writing software that scales.

Current Efforts:

- DIZZY STORM (V->P): A handbook for Software Development
- DIZZY DISCO (N->V): A DIZZY infrastructure compiler

Current DIZZY projects:

- DIZZY DEDUPE: An example application

## Project Structure

This is a **monorepo** organized as follows:

- **`pkg/`** - Core DIZZY package and framework
- **`app/`** - Test applications demonstrating DIZZY patterns (e.g., `app/dedupe/`)

The project uses a **uv monorepo** for packaging and **justfiles** to record common commands.

## DIZZY Program Schema

DIZZY applications are structured around **4 Flow Components** that form a continuous cycle:

**Commands → Procedures → Events → Policies → Commands**

This architecture leverages **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**:

- **Queriers**: Read-only operations consumed by Procedures and Policies
- **Mutators**: Write operations that operate on various Models
- **Commands**: Trigger actions in the system
- **Procedures**: Execute business logic and emit Events
- **Events**: Capture state changes
- **Policies**: React to Events and may trigger new Commands

## Application Structure

DIZZY applications (e.g., `app/dedupe/`) follow a standard directory layout:

- **`def/`** - YAML and LinkML definitions of Commands, Procedures, Models, Events, and Policies
- **`gen/`** - Auto-generated Pydantic models and Python interfaces (generated by DIZZY from `def/`)
- **`procedures/`** - Implementation of Procedure interfaces
- **`policies/`** - Implementation of Policy interfaces
- **`deployment/`** - Deployment configurations and infrastructure code

The workflow is: define your schema in `def/`, generate code into `gen/`, then implement the interfaces in `procedures/` and `policies/`.

## Developer Setup

This is a **uv monorepo** with multiple packages and applications managed as a workspace.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner (optional, for convenience)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ConradMearns/dizzy.git
   cd dizzy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

### Documentation

View and edit documentation using MkDocs:

```bash
# Serve docs locally
uv run mkdocs serve
```

### Using Justfiles

This project uses `justfiles` for common tasks. Run `just` in any directory to see available commands.

### Dizzy CLI

The `dizzy` package provides CLI tools for working with LinkML schemas:

```bash
# List entities from schema definitions
uv run dizzy list commands def      # List all commands
uv run dizzy list events def        # List all events
uv run dizzy list queries def       # List all queries
uv run dizzy list procedures def    # List all procedures
uv run dizzy list --verbose def     # Show descriptions

# Generate architecture diagram
uv run dizzy diagram --def-dir def --output architecture.mermaid
```
