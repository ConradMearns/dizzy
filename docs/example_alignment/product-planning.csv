# Feature Mapping:
# F00: relationship-scoring - 5/3/1 strength indicators to quantify problem-need-feature connections
# F01: flat-relationship-scoring - Only use a strength indicator of 1 to quantify problem-need-feature connections
#
# Interaction strength values: 5 (strong), 3 (medium), 1 (weak), --- (none/unknown)
