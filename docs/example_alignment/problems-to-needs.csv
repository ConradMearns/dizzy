# Need Mapping:
# N00: evidence-based-scoring - Relationship strengths grounded in data, metrics, and measurable outcomes rather than opinions
# N01: diverse-perspectives - Input from varied stakeholders, domains, and roles to surface blind spots
# N02: dependency-mapping - Model prerequisites, sequences, and which features enable or block others
# N03: feedback-loop-awareness - Consider second-order effects, emergent behaviors, and how solutions interact
#
# Interaction strength values: 5 (strong), 3 (medium), 1 (weak), --- (none/unknown)
