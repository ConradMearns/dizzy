> “Start Where You Are. Use What You Have. Do What You Can.” - Arthur Ashe

There isn't one particular goal with this project, this repository is meant to serve as a piece of living proof of failure and progress.

We are engine building - bootstrapping a paradigm for processing that can survive shifting paradigms, requirements, domains, whim and fancy alike. It is the bastard child of many problems:

- Contract work typically demands a new bespoke system be created every 1-3 years. This is fun - but not sustainable. What if we could carry over the largest least-interesting piece of technology every time to provide a backbone for developing and exploring new paradigms instead of re-inventing the wheel every time?

- Questions of which database are best suited for the user, what UI JS frontend is coolest, what programming language is most likely to provide job stability are tired. _It should not matter_ what of these decisions we make now, because we are more likely to be wrong than right anyway. Therefor - we would be better equipped for these questions if we had an architecture that granted us the grace of making these mistakes and correcting them - rather than living with the pain of our ignorance forever.

Besides these burning problems - we also have a general burning desire that we share. _Surely some things could be better_.

The architecture we build here is intended not to be the best - but to be as flexible as possible to the point we know longer care about what's best.

# What the heck is this for

- Running pipelines that can be resumed later
	- Let me write a quick script that will never be used for production workflows real quick...
- Replacing Jupyter as a scientific processing tool to accelerate TRL
	- DAG's are everywhere and in-memory objects are not to be trusted
- Meta-programming without DSL's or Monkey-patching
	- cool IaC bro, can I have a diagram?
- The MO - Moving Objects
	- hey can you send me those vacation photos of me? thx <3
- ???
	- do u got games on ur phone
